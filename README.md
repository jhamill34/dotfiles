# Personal Dotfiles

## Nix

To start we need to make sure that Nix is installed. I first did this using the 
["Determinate Nix Installer"](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer?tab=readme-ov-file#determinate-nix-installer). There seems to be a nice CLI way to do it but I opted for doing the GUI one. 


## Dotfiles

To install the configuration files. We can use: 

```bash 
stow . 
```

## Future Work 

- [ ] Redoing our Tmux Config
- [ ] Redoing our Neovim config (mini nvim, snack.nvim, and kickstart)
- [ ] Using home manager to install our dot files
- [ ] Use nix to configure our personal laptop with a user for Amanda
- [ ] Try out hammerspoon mac app 
- [ ] Try out karabeaner 
- [ ] Sketchybar sounds fun
- [ ] Add our ghostty config here too
