// Derived from the `spaces` mod shipped with Herdr (Apache-2.0, https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr-app).
// Modified by 0OZ: New space button, initial tiles, nested worktrees on guide lines, ahead/behind counts.
// Modified by José Gutiérrez (minimalistic, 0oz design fork): renamed from oz-spaces; each space lists its agents (agents.js), folded by clicking the space. The active space is a faint wash of the text color, never a theme accent.
// Modified by jlopezlira (Kanso, https://github.com/jlopezlira/herdr-kanso): renamed from mn-spaces; a fixed 76px rail when collapsed (resizable only when open), space avatars in the theme's hues, a breathing dot instead of a spinner, background polling slowed when the window is behind.
// Modified by Iván Campaña (https://github.com/icampana): layout writers set the tree only when it is Kanso's, so a switch from another layout never saves that layout into kanso.json.
// Workspace spaces: stable colored avatars, worktrees under their checkout,
// grouped by machine when more than one is known. After a space's name, the repo
// its first terminal is in now, only where unusual: branch, ahead/behind. Its agents are listed under it (agents.js). Click to
// switch, right-click for its menu, drag to reorder.
