// Kanso's side panels, by jlopezlira (https://github.com/jlopezlira/herdr-kanso). Apache-2.0.
//
// One mod, several panels: `props.panel` is "files" (a lazy file browser),
// "pr" (the branch's pull
// request, or another of your open ones picked from a list), "shipped" (what
// you delivered: lines, pull requests, reviews, streak and records), "worktrees"
// (every git worktree on this computer, and removing the ones left behind) or "preview" (one file, rendered: Markdown as the SDK draws it,
// anything else as read-only code; `props.path`, `props.on`). kanso-tabs mounts one of them in the panel stack on demand and
// empties the stack to close it, so a panel exists only while it is shown
// and never has to watch whether it is. Each panel is a plain class with
// init(cx, props) and render(cx); what they share (where the focused pane is, diff
// rows) is in lib.js. Herdr lets a mod import its own files, not another's:
// this is why the three live together.
