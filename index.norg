*** Docs

    I think that we'll want to use markdown or neorg as the way we document information. 

    I think that this will give us a good way to also interact with Claude or Codex. 

    We can then figure out a way to sync to Notion for broad consumption (or just keep the wiki on github for documents). 
    Seems like there's a Github action for pushing to Notion but a 2-way sync might be hard. 

    Once we have a living doc for a project we could then try to use AI to generate some tasks based on the codebase that could 
    live in Linear. I'm sure there's an API that we could use here. The goal of the doc would be to gather requirements. 
    I mainly want to capture the business justification with sign off from product as well as "acceptance criteria" that would 
    serve as the north star of the task. 

    After the business requirements we would want to capture the high level changes this would require working backwards from the
    requirements and using the current state to inform these steps. These steps could serve as starting points for linear tasks
    and would want to estimate this. From here we want to find a happy medium between going full on "waterfall" that would 
    require a top-down planning down to details and the ability to be flexible and piviot as needed. 

    The steps from here are:

    ~ Write an "idea" doc that includes business justification and outcome
    ~ When marked as relevant or a priority break down into technical chunks.
    ~ Get Sign off from *Product*
    ~ Get Sign off from *Eng*
    ~ Create Linear tickets from technical chunks and provide estimates 
    ~ Repeat 5 until estimates are doable in a day (use AI as needed here).

    Would be kind of cool if we could structure these "docs" in a stacked PR way. Smaller chunks that that can be easily consumed.
    I guess this just the concept of breaking down tickets. /Tracking the number of "docs" will be a metric with associated approvals/

*** Source Code
    Obviously we will then use Github for our code and PRs. JJ and SPR will come in to play here for stacked diffs and trying
    to hit a defined "diff" metric. On top of stretching the communication skills and being uncomfortable we also want to push
    out a bunch of changes. At least one diff a day (more would be better) would be the goal. /We can track the diff metric/

> Would be great if we had an aggregator to combine these sources into a single source of truth and then send updates. 

*** Messaging
    Slack will be used for real time communication. Slash commands within slack will be for creating tickets and tracking tasks. 
    Maybe within linear we can create a personal board for me to track my work related tasks. This comes back to the same issue 
    as always.... where do we track personal tasks. Should we try to use linear for personal tasks?

*** Email
    Gmail for long form formal updates (i.e. weekly updates or project updates) where we would send oncall updates or general
    things that would make slack noisey. 

*** Calendar 
    Google Calendar will be where we store our time blocking. This will be useful for visualizing our time spent in various 
    places and if we actually decide to move to Sunsama then we can use those features for time blocking and planning. 

*** Video Conference
    The zoom integration will be for AI meeting notes that we can throw into our document system as well as integrations into 
    Google calendar to add a zoom link on meetings. 

    Speaking of meetings we're going to want to set up 1:1s with the team right away and make sure that we have Notion notes 
    to keep track of the "minutes" and action items that come out of a meeting. We should also practice the "pre-meeting" system
    to better prepare for meetings.
    ---

** Time Management
*** Routines
    - Morning Check-ins
    - End of Day Updates
    - Meetings
    - Pre-meeting prep
    - Weekly Project Updates
    - one-on-ones with leadership
    - 90 minute pomodoros (kind of in tandem with the other alarms)

*** Flexibility
**** High Energy 
     - Requires a light calendar
     - Focus on ambiguity 
     - 1 major task + documentation
**** Medium Energy
     - Focus on completion, at the end of the week focus on what is 80% done
     - 3-4 medium tasks + collaboration
**** Low Energy
     - Sometimes due to a packed calendar
     - 5-8 small tasks + stay visible

*** Alarms
    - 10:30am - /Did I post an update?/
    - 2:00pm - /Am I working on the right thing?/
    - 4:30pm - /Post EOD update/
    - Calendar to have two alarms with built in "transition time". Always allow 15 minute breather between events on calendar.
    -- 15 minutes (start a brain dump so that it doesn't feel so bad to stop and allows us to pick up later)
    -- 5 minutes (stand up and say out loud DONE)

*** Triage
    - Intake during morning check-in (linear, slack, email, personal list)
    - Eisenhower matrix (Important + Urgency)
    -- Do Now
    -- Delegate 
    -- Schedule (This week, this month, this quarter, etc.)

*** Morning Check-in
    - Check linear for highest priority or quickest win
    - only aim to do ONE thing to consider the day a win

** Quick Dopamine Hits that add value
   - Review PR
   - close a small bug
   - Help out on slack

** When low energy and hyperfocus ends (require a time bound)
   - take a real world break
   - Review PRs
   - Organize linear
   - Update documentation

** Templates
   - Stakeholder updates for work
   - Weekly Progress summary
   - Monthly Progress summary
   - Meeting updates (pre-meeting prep)
   - Triage Templates

**** Triage Templates

     Response templates:
     - "I can help with this. Currently working on [X], can pick this up by [date]. Does that work?"
     - "This isn't in my current sprint. Let me check with [VP Eng] on priorities."
     - "I'm oncall, need to focus on that. Can [teammate] help or can this wait until [date]?"

** Goals
   - Share a "Today I Learned" in a public channel
   - Daily updates, don't leave the day without "speaking" to someone
   - Ask a question in a public channel 
   - Share Docs before its "done"
   - Talk in meetings, camera on
   - Regularly demo our work that we've done
   - Ask leadership questions in sync meetings rather than 1:1s
   - Keep a "brag doc" and/or a "brave moments doc"
   - Try working sessions to body double with work (we could even frame them as "office hours") 

** Preventative Protocols
   - Set alarms through out the day 
   - Everything we work on needs to be visible (even small tooling stuff). 
   - Personal projects NEED to wait until after hours or scheduled (20% time?) *this shouldn't happen until we prove discipline*

** Emergency Protocols
*** Going Silent
    - /few hours/ - Post an update NOW
    - /a whole day/ - Send update about yesterday and now, send manager an update as well directly acknowledging the silence

*** Wrong Priority
    - Acknowledge, and send update
    - Document learnings so some value can be gleaned 
    - Switch back to highest priority OR quickest win OR make case for this being priority.
